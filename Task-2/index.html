           <h1>Will Earth <span>Survivable</span> ??</h1>
           <p>Environmental issues were not a matter of concern in the years gone by. People were not aware of the grave implications of environmental degradation. Lack of awareness leads to more damage to the environment. With the rise of the internet, everyone is aware of environmental issues today. Not all of them understand the deeper meaning of each one of those issues. However, given the state of the earth, people realize that all is not well.<br> <br>There is a way in which every person cares for the environment. Some people respect it. Some try to nurture it. The crucial issues related to the situation today are mainly global warming, greenhouse effect, and climate change. Global warming is the increase in temperature of the earth due to the overconsumption of resources. It leads to other environmental issues like changes in temperature, soil erosion, and abnormal rainfall. Global warming can be tackled through control of pollution levels, lower vehicular emissions, and a person’s carbon footprint.<br><br> The green-house effect is named after the greenhouse arrangement. Such an arrangement is usually made for the growth of plants. It consists of a non-permanent structure with sturdy enclosures. The green-house effect refers to the rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We all know that human beings take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide. Similarly, plants take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen. Rapid deforestation leads to a reduction in the number of trees and plants in the environment. Therefore there are very few plants to take in the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We must remember that humans are not the only source of carbon dioxide. <br><br>Carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere through factories too. There are other reasons for the emission of carbon dioxide into the air. This carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere if not taken in by the trees. Excess carbon dioxide can lead to breathing problems and other medical problems in the future. Greenhouse gases constitute not only carbon dioxide but other harmful gasses like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. These gases are released into the atmosphere through the various chemical plants. The best way to minimize the effect of green-house gases is afforestation programs.</p><br>

                <h3>Pollution</h3>
                <p>There are different types of pollution: water pollution, air pollution, solid waste pollution and noise pollution. All of these can be found in urban areas. The main sources of pollution are household activities, factories, agriculture and transport. </p><br>

                <h3>Ozone Layer</h3>
                <p>Ozone depletion is caused by the release of chemicals, primarily chlorine and bromide, into the atmosphere. A single atom of either has the potential to destroy thousands of ozone molecules before leaving the stratosphere.Ozone depletion results in more UVB radiation reaching the Earth’s surface. </p><br>

                <h3>Ocean Acidification</h3>
                <p> Ocean acidification is the term used to describe the continued lowering of the pH levels of the Earth’s oceans as a result of carbon dioxide emissions. It is estimated that ocean acidity will increase by 150% by 2100 if efforts aren’t made to halt it.This increase in acidification can have dire effect on calcifying species, such as shellfish. </p><br>

                    We are facing an unprecedented ecological crisis in our country today, on all fronts, including land, water and air. Need of the hour is a concerted effort from all stakeholders, to realize the emergency and act accordingly. Sustainability cannot be an academic discussion, it needs to be an on-ground practice, for there is no planet B. Vimlendu Jha is currently one of India’s foremost environmentalists.

                    Science is the endeavor that allows us to describe our natural world and how it works. Science gives us the power and knowledge to understand our environment, recognize problems, and quantify threats. But science doesn’t tell us how to use that knowledge.
