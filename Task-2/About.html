            <h1>Will Earth <span>Survivable</span> ??</h1>
            <p>Environmental issues were not a matter of concern in the years gone by. People were not aware of the grave implications of environmental degradation. Lack of awareness leads to more damage to the environment. With the rise of the internet, everyone is aware of environmental issues today. Not all of them understand the deeper meaning of each one of those issues. However, given the state of the earth, people realize that all is not well.<br> <br>There is a way in which every person cares for the environment. Some people respect it. Some try to nurture it. The crucial issues related to the situation today are mainly global warming, greenhouse effect, and climate change. Global warming is the increase in temperature of the earth due to the overconsumption of resources. It leads to other environmental issues like changes in temperature, soil erosion, and abnormal rainfall. Global warming can be tackled through control of pollution levels, lower vehicular emissions, and a person’s carbon footprint.<br><br> The green-house effect is named after the greenhouse arrangement. Such an arrangement is usually made for the growth of plants. It consists of a non-permanent structure with sturdy enclosures. The green-house effect refers to the rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We all know that human beings take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide. Similarly, plants take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen. Rapid deforestation leads to a reduction in the number of trees and plants in the environment. Therefore there are very few plants to take in the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We must remember that humans are not the only source of carbon dioxide. <br><br>Carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere through factories too. There are other reasons for the emission of carbon dioxide into the air. This carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere if not taken in by the trees. Excess carbon dioxide can lead to breathing problems and other medical problems in the future. Greenhouse gases constitute not only carbon dioxide but other harmful gasses like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. These gases are released into the atmosphere through the various chemical plants. The best way to minimize the effect of green-house gases is afforestation programs.</p><br>

            <h1>Our <span>Achievments</span></h1>
            <p>1. Pollution
                There are 7 key types of pollution – air, water, soil, noise, radioactive, light and thermal and these are primary causes that affect our environment in many ways. All these types of pollution are interlinked and influence each other. Therefore we need to tackle all of them together.<br> <br> 2. Soil Degradation
                Globally, food security depends on the factor whether or not soils are in good condition to produce crops. According to UN estimates, about 12 million hectares of farmland a year get seriously degraded. <br><br> 3. Global Warming
                Climate changes like global warming are the result of human practices like the emission of greenhouse gases. Global warming leads to rising temperatures of the oceans and the earth’ surface causing natural disasters that include flooding, melting of polar ice caps, rise in sea levels and also unnatural patterns of precipitation such as flash floods, hurricanes, wildfires, drought, excessive snow or desertification.<br><br>4. Overpopulation
                The population of the planet is reaching unsustainable levels as it faces a shortage of resources like water, fuel and food. Population explosion in less developed and developing countries is straining the already scarce resources.<br> <br>5. Generating Unsustainable Waste
                The huge production of waste due to our hyperconsumption is a major threat to the environment. As per the study, the average person produces 4.3 pounds of waste per day, and the US alone accounting for 220 million tons a year. <br><br>6. Waste Disposal
                The overconsumption of resources and the creation of plastics are creating a global crisis of waste disposal. Developed countries are notorious for producing an excessive amount of waste or garbage and dumping their waste in the oceans and less developed countries.<br><br>7. Polar Ice Caps
                The issue of the melting of polar ice caps is a contentious one. Although NASA studies have shown that the amount of ice in Antarctica is increasing, however, this increase is only one-third of what is being lost in the Arctic.<br><br>8. The Nitrogen Cycle
                We often ignore the effects of the use of nitrogen by humans. Nitrogen is a crucial component of all life. Problems occur when the nitrogen cycle is not balanced. <br><br>9. Overfishing
                Overfishing affects natural ecosystems severely and leads to an imbalance of ocean life. Around 63% of global fish stocks are estimated to be overfished. Overfishing caused fishing fleets to migrate to new waters that would further deplete the fish stocks.<br> <br>10. Public Health Issues
                The current environmental problems pose a lot of risk to the health of humans and animals. Dirty water is the biggest health risk in the world and poses a threat to the quality of life and public health.</p><br><a class="learn" href="#top">Go to Top</a>
